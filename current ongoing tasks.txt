3 environments SIT UAT prod
SIT was tested completely and working fine
then build was transfered to UAT, issues in deployment because all APIs were changed
UAT is used by merchants and they were facing a lot of issues in testing the card method
dependency on APIs so if the APIs are not working then the landing page will not work 
TPS did this project in old .net and we worked in .net core so there are a lot of things that were changed and needed to be tested which took a lot of time as well.
